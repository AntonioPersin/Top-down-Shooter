A Unity3d project I started working on recently. I'm working on it when I have the time. 

For now it is mostly here to showcase the proof of concept. I will be implementing gameplay features and levels first, before any models, textures and other art design aspects. 

It is imagined as a top-down shooter with a fixed camera. It has standard WASD movement controls and active abilities on characters. 
Currently I am working on a modular abilities system. I am aiming to make creating abilities easy and quick. Goal would be to have a system that could create a fully fledged character kit only using the editor. Selecting a script for a straight line skillshot, 
adding scripts for projectile interactions and scripts for projectile detonation, etc. This way I could make varaiety of basic characters quickly, each with multiple active abilities. 

Enemies are supposed to be zombies that would similarly feature different special variants. Those variants could use the same ability creating kit to give them active abilities that would distinguish them from regular zombies. Using spawners, other level 
defining objects and basic geometrical shapes I could create simple levels to start working on mission/level logic.
